# Vocabulary List Generator

## Description:
üìùThis program queries Google, WikiPedia and Oxford Dictionary for the definitions of multiple words and compiles these definitions into a single "vocabulary" list

## Installation
Open cmd 
``` 
cd <PATH FOR INSTALLATION>
git clone https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage:
Simply enter words separated by commas into the program and it will return the list of words and the top definition for each word.

Note: Part of the program is still quite unstable and may not always give the most relevant definition

## Dependencies:
The program uses the following libraries:
<a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium">Selenium</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet">PyFiglet</a>
<br>
The libraries have been taken care of in the <a href="https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen/releases">exe release</a>
<br><br>
However, all users will need to get the **matching/compatible** versions of Google Chrome and [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). Make sure that the chromedriver.exe file is in the same directory as the application.
Eg. If you have Chrome 86, download the ChromeDriver v86 from the above link and place the exe in the same directory as this program.

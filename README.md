<h1 align="center">MultiDefine</h1>

## About the Project:
üìùThis program queries Google, WikiPedia and Oxford Dictionary for the definitions of multiple words and compiles these definitions into a single list of definitions.

It was created to help with my schoolwork, which often involved finding definitions of a long list of technical words. I realised I was wasting a lot of time manually searching the definitons of each of the words and writing them down, so I decided to automate this process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* The program has been built and tested on Windows 10+ machines, so its recommended to use a Windows Machine
* If using MacOS or other environments, try the manual installation process. If you have any issues, please create a new issue [here](https://github.com/museHD/MultiDefine/issues)
* For manual installation, [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) needs to be installed

Use one of the following methods to use the program:

- #### Manual Installation
  Open a terminal,
  ``` 
  cd <PATH FOR INSTALLATION>
  git clone https://github.com/museHD/MultiDefine
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- #### Downloading Release (Only on Windows)
  It is recommended to create a separate folder for the application.
  Download the latest [release](https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen/releases) to the folder and run it. 
  Most of the dependencies will be contained within the release and those that aren't will be downloaded to the folder.


### Usage:

- #### Manually Installed
  Open a terminal.
  Run using `python multidefine.py`
- #### EXE File
  Open the folder where the exe is downloaded.
  Double click to run the program.

Simply enter words separated by commas into the program and it will return the list of words and the top definition for each word.
Note: Part of the program is still quite unstable and may not always give the most relevant definition.

# Vocabulary List Generator

## Description:
üìùThis program queries Google, WikiPedia and Oxford Dictionary for the definitions of multiple words and compiles these definitions into a single "vocabulary" list

## Installation

Use one of the following methods:

- ### Using Terminal
  Open a terminal 
  ``` 
  cd <PATH FOR INSTALLATION>
  git clone https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- ### Downloading Release
  It is recommended to create a separate folder for the application.
  Download the latest [release](https://github.com/museHD/Vocab-List-Gen/releases) to the folder and run it. 
  Most of the dependencies should be contained within the release and those that aren't will be downloaded to the folder.


## Usage:
Simply enter words separated by commas into the program and it will return the list of words and the top definition for each word.

Note: Part of the program is still quite unstable and may not always give the most relevant definition
